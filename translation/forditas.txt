Introduction
  An introduction on geoinformatics, a new branch of information technology, using both graphical and database knowledges. In the 1600's mathematics have become the basis for almost every natural sciences, as information technology in our days. Based on high standards, professional softwares, database technologies, graphical representations are used and applied widely among almost every science areas. By keeping the primary goals of geoinformatics,  information technologies have been applying their newest achievements in geoinformation sytstems. New methodologies have been introduced for representing and analyzing spatial based data.
  In the following chapters, concepts, theoratical ideas used by geoinformatics will be introduced. Mathematical methods, principles and algorithms behind softwares are being dicussed in detail. We think it's crucial for students, attending practive oriented classes,that they should get familiar with methods and principles behind geoinformation sysytems, along with their routinish user level and practical problem solvers. 
  Further goals of this material is to introduce a rapidly expanding world of open source technologies. Although only theoratical concepts will be discussed, further materials will rely on these knowledge to introduce problems solved by opensource tools and programming libraries. The world of opensource are relying on modern theoratical, computer science background what we will discuss in the following chapters. Interestingly, the world of opensource are progressing in a much faster pace then commercial softwares, who are essentially aiming for higher profit, thus their software concept only changes when it is inevitable by loosing profit. That's not how opensource world operates, they would rather focusing on technical challenges.
  While editing this material on opensource technologies, bearing in mind that beyond theoratical knowledge, fully functional GIS applications and programming libraries which do not require existing spatial softwares, rather funciontalities are coming from the users by experience.

  What is spatial?
  By first glance the earth is spherical, which leads to the use of polar-coordinate system, having lambda and theta angles with r radius giving any P point coordinate's. (Let's accept this abstract approach, although we know that, the earth is not spherical from projections and referenced surface is not spherical).
  One of the most important task of a map is to express spatiality by representing the earth on a spherical surface. Wether you are using a spatially flat traditional paper map or a digital map on a monitor, both methods needed projection from spherical to planer resulting distortion of the original image. A spherical surface can not be projected to planer surface without undistorted. Projection theory are dealing with similar problems.
  Let us assume that, projected planer maps are avaiable before building a spatial information system. The only exception is data measured by GPS, which are fundamentally geographical coordinates (although transformation is applicable into planer surface).
  Vectorized digital maps have been projected into planer surface by analog source map. Plane to plane transformations are needed when changing projection systems, calibration, georeferencing operations are done. As an example for importing digitalized map, and reproject it into a new projection system, plane to plane transformation is needed.
  In case of remote sensed images, ground control coordinates defines the reference points between relative coordinates of source images and real coordinates of transformed images. In the following sections, we will discuss some of the mostly used planer transformations in geoinformation systems.
  
  Planer transformations
  Put the case that we have a paper map in a given projection systems. Our task is to vectorize it. During vectorization we may keep the source projections system, although we could transform it into new projection system if required.
  Generally raster based digitalized maps are scanned in relative coordinate system (upper-left coordinate is the origin, size are measured in pixels), transformation (georefrencing) is needed into real coorindate system.
  Let's take a look at figure 2., which describes the possible plane transformations like, congruent, isomorph, affine, projective and topologic. For every single transformations invariants are related, which remain constant during transformation.
    Figure 2. Possible planer transformations> 1. Congruent, 2: Isomorph, 3: Affine, 4: Projective, 5: Topological

  > Congurent transformation
  During transformation neither it's size or shape changes.

  > Isomorph transformation
  During isomorph transformation feature's size do change, however it's shape does not. Usually named Conform transformation, due to the angles are not modified during transformation (figure 3.).
    Figure 3. Example for conform transformation: 1: Orientation preserved conform transformation, 2: Inverted orientation conform transformation a) source feature b) transformed feature.

  > Affine transformation
  During affine transformation both it's size and shape are changed, but parallelity is preserved. Note that included angles are not invariants.
    Figure 4. Affine transformation: 1: Original shape, 2: Transformed shape.
  As shown in figure 4. A'B' <> AB and A' angle <> A angle, although A'D' || B'C', additionally every each point on AD lies on A'D'. 
  Equation for affine transformation:
    x' = ax + by
    y' = cx + dy
  The following table summarizes affine transformation's properties: image
  Affine transformation is one of the mostly used transformation method in Geoinformatics. Georeferencing action is applied, when the source map is a scanned raster image, relative coordinates are correlated to referenced coordinates, which is an affine transformation. Most of the coordinate system transformations are based on affine transformation method. 

  > Projective transformation
  During projective transformation none of the following properties are changed: size, shape and parallelity, but straight lines remain straight. This type of transformation is scarcely used on vector based data types. Although projective transformation may come handy for solving representation of 3 dimensional data, where perspective representation is needed.

  > Topological transformation
  During topological transformation angles, distances and parallelity are changed, however, continuity, ordinality and vicinity properties are intact. This type of transformation became relevant when affine transformation did not give correct result, due to the deformation of raster based data during georeferecing.
  Deformation may occur in the course of scanning a raster map, the scanner's paper transfer rollers may slid the paper. In these cases, event a correct georeferecing does not give correct transformation. Despite of correct ground control points and available known points with correct coordinates, which are detectable on the scanned map are not in the correct position. In cases like this, affine transformation is performed location by location, with adding as many ground control points as possible.

  Tesselation
  There are two ways to cover a surface: regular and irregular tesselation. Figure 5 shows the base cases.
  The first case describes the process of segmentation on a paper map. Traditional cartographer's main concern with covering the selected area with paper based maps, which is segmentation.  During this process, they have selected the size of maps to cover the selected area, the type of thematical information to be used, the amount of information to display on the selected paparmap. Based on this standard scales and content have been developed. A section division and enlarged section can be seen in the lower right corner and the corresponded map are shown in figure 6. The surface of Hungary are covered with gap and overlap free in different scale and hierarchially organized sections. The ordinality of each section is tightly related to it's hierarchial position. 
    Figure 6. System of EOV sections, containing the are with 75-342 numbered section. 
    Figure 7. 75-342 map section.
  On figure 5. the second case is a correct tesselation. Information on surface are stored in grids, for example in case of remote sensed or aerial images intensity values on base colours, height values on digital terrain models, the normal value of data are derived from sampled grid data. For a sampled spot (e.g.: pixel) some area is rendered and every data stored within considered as valid data (figure 8.). So, in case of images, these are pixel having the same intensity values or height step with constant height value.
  On figure 5. the third and fourth cases are correct irregular tesselations. The third case cound demonstrates a surface covered by a set polygons with gap and overlap free defined by legal regulations or a scientific fact, like a geological map (figure 10.). Finally the fourth case demonstrates a polygon-system, generated by mathematical, to be exact geometrical algorithm coving the surface gap and overlap freely. Further materials are available on third case in "Vector datamodel", fourth case in "3D graphical, surface modelling" chapters.

  On figure 9. A portion of a cadastral map is shown (only cadastral boundaries), which clearly the usage of irregular coverage, where nor the regularity of sampling and neither the tesselation algorithms can not be observed.

  Maps and spatial functions

    Requirements agains a map can be shortly summarized in few sentences. A map is a model of the actual world, representing the earth surface by a predefined set of rules along with it's properties. We expect the model to guide, navigate, identify our current position spatially and relatively to anchor objects. A model should help us reviewing a larger area, as well as providing all the relevant details on given area with certain context. It should be able to represent an occurence or process, physical quantity, spatial distribution, quality and quantitive measure, leading us to understand and judge a given problem if needed. By comparing multiple objects with their spatial expansion, we should be able to analyze the relation and interaction between these objects. In some cases, a model should provide an overall review on spatial data.
    Both traditional paper maps and modern digital maps fulfill the above listed functionalities. In case of paper based maps,
